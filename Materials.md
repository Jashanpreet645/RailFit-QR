## **Mild Steel (Low-Carbon Steel)**

- **Composition:** ~0.05–0.25% carbon, relatively ductile, uniform grain structure.

- **Reaction to Laser:**

  - **Absorption:** Steel surfaces absorb laser energy well, especially if oxidized or coated (bare polished steel reflects more).

  - **Engraving Quality:** Produces clean, sharp engravings because mild steel melts and vaporizes in a controlled way.

  - **Surface Effect:** The laser can locally heat and oxidize the surface, leaving a blackened or oxidized mark if low power is used, or a deep cut/engraving if higher power is applied.

  - **Behavior:** Predictable, less brittle → less risk of cracking.

## **Cast Iron**

- **Composition:** ~2–4% carbon + silicon, with graphite flakes (in gray cast iron) or nodules (in ductile iron).

- **Reaction to Laser:**

  - **Absorption:** Also absorbs laser well, but because of high carbon and graphite content, the heat distribution is uneven.

  - **Engraving Quality:**

    - Can produce rougher engravings compared to steel.

    - The graphite flakes cause localized vaporization and spalling, which can lead to pitting or uneven depth.

  - **Surface Effect:** The engraving often looks darker/rougher (due to carbon burning and redeposition).

  - **Behavior:** Cast iron is brittle, so under intense laser heating, microcracks or small chips can form around the engraved zones.

  - Sometimes a powdery residue (oxidized carbon/iron) remains on the surface.
