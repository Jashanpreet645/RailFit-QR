Core MVP (absolute baseline)

Goal: vendor fills component data → web app generates a Spotify-style barcode → backend stores UID → hardware (ESP32 + Engraver-2) engraves barcode → employee scans barcode in browser → app returns component details.

Tech stack (core)

Frontend: React (Create React App or Next.js)

Libraries: JsBarcode or custom SVG renderer, Quagga2 or zxing-js for browser scanning.

Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Django REST Framework

Libraries: uvicorn, sqlalchemy/psycopg2 (Postgres), pydantic

DB: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (local dev)

ML (minimal): Python stack for later (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch; OpenCV)

Hardware: ESP32, Nema-17, A4988 drivers, Engraver-2 laser module, 12V LiPo or bench PSU

Tools: Git, Docker (optional), Postman

Step-by-step: Core MVP
A. Define barcode encoding (Spotify-like 23-bar)

Spec — decide representation rules:

23 bars total, each bar height ∈ {1..8} (8 levels).

Fixed bars: bar1=1, bar12=9units (we’ll implement as max-height codepoint), bar23=1 — these are sync/validation bars.

Use bars 2–11 and 13–22 (20 bars) to encode a unique identifier (UID) and a checksum.

UID format:

Backend generates a short UID (e.g., 12 bytes hex or base36 like TF2025-000128).

Encoding algorithm (recommended):

Convert UID bytes → large integer → convert to base-8 representation with length 20 → map digits 0..7 → heights 1..8 (add +1 offset). Reserve a checksum digit (last of 20) derived from CRC8 or mod-97.

Insert fixed bars at positions 1,12,23.

Why this: you keep a compact mapping, you can reconstruct UID losslessly (if no heavy damage), and you have fixed bars for a quick authenticity check.

Example: UID → integer → base8 digits → 20 digits → heights (digit+1) → build SVG.

B. Backend: UID generation, store mapping, and API

Tasks

Create API endpoints:

POST /generate — accepts vendor form, generates UID, stores in DB, returns barcode SVG/PNG and G-code payload for engraver.

GET /component/{uid} — returns component details.

POST /scan-event — logs a scan event (who, where, when).

DB schema (simplified):

components(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  uid TEXT UNIQUE,
  vendor TEXT,
  part_no TEXT,
  batch_no TEXT,
  mfg_date DATE,
  warranty_until DATE,
  location TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

scans(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  uid TEXT,
  scanned_by TEXT,
  geo_location JSON,
  device_info JSON,
  scan_time TIMESTAMP
);


Implement image/G-code export:

Save generated barcode SVG to storage.

Generate a G-code snippet for the laser (explained later).

Libraries / commands:

Python: pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy alembic psycopg2-binary python-multipart python-jose cryptography

C. Frontend: Generate page + Scan page

Generate page:

Vendor fills the form (fields we listed earlier).

On submit, call POST /generate.

Display barcode SVG and "Download / Send to Engraver" buttons.

Scan page:

Use Quagga2 or zxing-js to capture the camera stream and detect barcode image area.

Important: standard barcode decoders won’t decode your custom 23-bar pattern — build a custom decoding routine:

Capture frame.

Preprocess: convert to grayscale → adaptive threshold → morphological clean.

Detect bounding rectangle of the barcode.

For each of 23 bar columns (divide bounding rect width by 23), compute topmost black pixel / run length → convert to discrete heights (quantize to 1..8).

Verify fixed bars. If valid → map heights back to UID via base8 decode → call backend GET /component/{uid}.

Frontend libraries:

react, axios, jsbarcode (if you fallback to normal barcodes), @ericblade/quagga2 or zxing-js/library.

Code sketch (JS) — render 23-bar SVG

function render23BarSVG(heights, barWidth=6, gap=2) {
  const totalW = heights.length * (barWidth + gap);
  let svg = `<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='${totalW}' height='120'>`;
  heights.forEach((h, i) => {
    const x = i * (barWidth + gap);
    const barH = h * 10; // scale
    const y = 120 - barH;
    svg += `<rect x='${x}' y='${y}' width='${barWidth}' height='${barH}' fill='black'/>`;
  });
  svg += `</svg>`;
  return svg;
}

D. Hardware: convert barcode → G-code → engrave

High-level approach

For a 1D bar pattern, generate vector rectangles (each bar is a rectangle). Convert each rectangle to a short G-code stroke where the laser is ON while traversing the rectangle height.

Minimal G-code recipe (pseudo)

G0 Xx Yy ; move to start

M3 S{power} ; enable laser (or use M106 for PWM)

G1 Xx Yy F{speed} ; linear move with laser on (engraving)

M5 ; laser off

Steps

From the backend, generate per-bar G-code commands (one stroke per bar, top→bottom).

Use a GRBL-like firmware on ESP32 (there are GRBL ports for ESP32) or run a small G-code parser on the ESP32 that receives G-code via HTTP or WebSocket.

ESP32 drives steppers (A4988) via step/direction pins and toggles laser via a MOSFET connected to a PWM/digital pin (through transistor + flyback protection).

Safety: include an interlock switch on the enclosure that disables laser unless closed; an emergency stop; ventilation.

Wiring highlights

Stepper power → separate 12V/24V supply to A4988 VMOT.

A4988 GND common with ESP32 GND.

Laser Engraver-2 12V module powered separately; control signal from ESP32 through a logic-level MOSFET (e.g., IRLZ44 or small N-MOSFET).

Use current limiting on A4988 and microstepping via MS1/MS2/MS3 pins.

Calibration

Compute steps_per_mm by moving known distances and adjusting GRBL config.

Tune laser power, speed, focus on sample pieces.

E. Testing & Validation (core)

Generate a set of test UIDs, render SVG → engrave on wood/aluminum/rubber.

Perform multiple scans with mobile browsers and PC webcams; verify decoding reliability.

Log scan events to the backend.

Check that fixed bars are correctly validated and that tampered/partial bars get flagged.

Advanced/Innovative features — step-by-step & tech stack

Below each feature I’ll give: objective → tech stack → ordered tasks → code/algorithm highlights → testing checklist.

1) Smart Barcodes with AI Diagnostics (dynamic health profile)

Objective: Every scan fetches a dynamic health profile (inspection logs + AI predictions).

Tech stack

Backend: FastAPI

ML: Python, TensorFlow/Keras OR PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost

DB: Postgres with JSONB for time-series logs

APIs: REST + WebSocket for real-time updates

Steps

Design schema to hold time-series sensor/inspection logs per UID.

Build ingestion API to accept inspection entries (human or IoT) → store as events (timestamp, metric, photo_url, inspector_id).

Train predictive model:

Data: historical inspection records, failure labels (if available).

Model: XGBoost for tabular predictions (probability of failure), or LSTM for time-series of sensor readings.

Serve model via FastAPI endpoint /predict/{uid} returning failure probability + recommended action.

Frontend: when showing component after scan, call /predict/{uid} and display a risk gauge + recommended next action.

Testing

Unit test model predictions on held-out set.

Simulate scans with mock data → verify UI shows health scores.

2) Offline + Delayed Sync

Objective: allow scans where network is weak; sync later.

Tech stack

Frontend: IndexedDB (via idb lib), Service Worker, Background Sync API

Backend: REST API endpoints consume batched scan events

Steps

Implement local persistence: when scan occurs and network offline → push event into IndexedDB queue.

Background Sync: register a background sync that triggers when connectivity returns and POSTs queued events.

Conflict handling: server assigns definitive timestamps; frontend reconciles if duplicate.

UI: show "pending sync" indicator and retry button.

Testing

Turn off network, do N scans → turn network on → ensure events uploaded and logged.

3) Fraud / Counterfeit Detection (cryptographic verification)

Objective: ensure barcode authenticity.

Approach & trade-offs

Online verification (simple + secure): barcode contains UID only; verification performed against server (trusted). Works if network available.

Offline verification (complex): embed cryptographic signature inside the barcode so scanner can verify authenticity locally. Requires more payload and public key distribution.

Recommended: Hybrid

Use server-side signature token + small on-barcode digest:

Backend generates token = base58(uid + short_checksum + truncated_HMAC) and stores full HMAC server-side.

The barcode contains token which client decodes to UID and asks server to validate token. If offline, the client uses a cached public key and a small signature included in token for quick local verification. Note: offline verification increases barcode payload; we advise using a 2D code (DataMatrix) if you require signatures.

Tech stack

Python cryptography library (ECDSA) or hmac for HMAC-SHA256

Public Key Infrastructure: generate signing key on server; distribute public key to verified field devices.

Implementation tasks

Server generates ECDSA key pair (secp256r1).

For each UID:

compute signature = sign(uid || timestamp)

Store signature and expiration on server

Create token = base64(uid + sig_truncated + ts)

Barcode encodes token (or stores UID + token)

Scanner decodes token:

If online → verify token with server API /verify-token.

If offline and public key cached → verify truncated signature locally (but truncated signatures reduce security; document tradeoff).

Testing

Fake token detection, expired token, reused token attempts.

4) Condition-based scanning (AI camera mode)

Objective: when scanning the barcode, also analyze the surrounding component area to detect rust, cracks, deformation.

Tech stack

Model: MobileNetV2 (transfer learning) or ResNet50 for classification/detection

CV: OpenCV for preprocessing & ROI (region of interest) extraction

Deployment: Serve model via FastAPI or run on-device using TensorFlow Lite (for Raspberry Pi later)

Steps

Collect dataset: photos of components labeled as “OK”, “rust”, “crack”, “deformation”.

Train classifier (transfer learning) — augment with rotations, lighting.

Integration:

After barcode bounding box detection, expand ROI to include component area.

Run CV preprocessing → feed into model → get class + confidence.

UI: show small thumbnail + "Condition: RUST (0.82 confidence)".

Testing

Run on sample pieces under various lighting; measure precision/recall.

5) Digital Twin & Lifecycle Tracking

Objective: full timeline (install → inspections → repairs → retire).

Tech stack

Backend: Postgres (events table), Graph representation optional (Neo4j later)

Frontend: Timeline UI (React + a timeline component)

Steps

DB: component_events(uid, type, payload_json, timestamp, user_id)

For each scan or maintenance task, append event.

UI: component page shows interactive timeline, filters by event type.

Provide export (PDF) for audit.

Testing

Create sample events and verify timeline rendering & filtering.

6) Hierarchical Inventory / Bulk Scanning

Objective: master barcode for boxes → expand into child UIDs.

Tech stack

Backend: batch import, CSV upload

Frontend: bulk generation UI & progress bar

Steps

Provide CSV template: columns for each child component details.

Backend: generate UIDs, generate one master record linking child UIDs.

Generate barcode for master (encodes master ID) and child barcodes for each component.

Scanning master triggers backend to mark all child components as “received”.

Testing

Bulk generate 100 rows, import, scan master, confirm children logged.

7) Vendor Performance Dashboard + AI scoring

Objective: give procurement intelligence — vendor scores & trends.

Tech stack

ML: scikit-learn / XGBoost

Visuals: React + Chart.js or Recharts

DB: aggregated metrics per vendor

Steps

Define vendor features: failure rate, mean time to failure, late deliveries, returns, warranty claims per 1000 items.

Train simple model/heuristic to compute score (0–100) — e.g., weighted average, or XGBoost if labeled data exists.

Build dashboard: time series charts, top/bottom vendors, alerts.

Testing

Validate score on synthetic historical data.

8) Auto-Alerts → Create TMS Tickets / SMS

Objective: automatically open maintenance tickets when scans show high risk.

Tech stack

Backend: job queue (Celery/RQ) for asynchronous tasks

Notifications: SMTP (email) + SMS gateway (Twilio or local SMS provider)

Integration: TMS/UDM APIs (mock for prototype)

Steps

When /predict/{uid} returns risk > threshold:

Create an internal ticket record.

Optionally call TMS API to open a ticket.

Send email/SMS to the responsible supervisor.

Dashboard shows open tickets and status.

Testing

Trigger sample high-risk event → ensure ticket creation + notifications.

9) AR-Assisted Overlay (stretch / wow factor)

Objective: AR overlay on camera showing component info and action items.

Tech stack

WebAR: AR.js or WebXR (browser support limited), Three.js for annotation

Alternative: native AR on mobile (future)

Steps

When scanning camera input, use the barcode bounding box to position a floating 2D/3D overlay.

Overlay shows key info: status, next_inspection, vendor, risk_score.

Smooth animation & clear UI to impress judges.

Testing

Test on an Android phone with Chrome + WebXR or fallback to AR.js.

Practical code snippets & algorithms (concrete)
A. Python — encode UID → 20 base8 digits (core algorithm)
def uid_to_base8_heights(uid_str, total_variable=20):
    # uid_str is a short unique string, e.g. 'TF2025-000128'
    import hashlib
    # compress UID to a deterministic integer via SHA256
    h = hashlib.sha256(uid_str.encode()).digest()
    n = int.from_bytes(h, 'big')
    # now convert to base 8 digits
    digits = []
    for _ in range(total_variable):
        digits.append(n % 8)
        n //= 8
    digits = digits[::-1]  # msd first
    # convert digits 0..7 to heights 1..8
    heights = [d + 1 for d in digits]
    return heights  # list length total_variable

B. Python — build 23-bar heights with fixed bars
def build_23_heights(uid_str):
    var = uid_to_base8_heights(uid_str)  # 20 values
    # fixed pattern: pos1=1, pos12=8 (we'll use 8 as "9-unit" visual), pos23=1
    heights = []
    heights.append(1)
    heights.extend(var[:10])     # bars 2..11
    heights.append(8)            # bar12 fixed (max)
    heights.extend(var[10:])     # bars 13..22
    heights.append(1)            # bar23 fixed
    assert len(heights) == 23
    return heights

C. Python — generate SVG of bars (server)
def svg_from_heights(heights, bar_w=6, gap=2, scale=10, height_px=120):
    w = len(heights)*(bar_w+gap)
    svg_parts = [f"<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='{w}' height='{height_px}'>"]
    for i,h in enumerate(heights):
        x = i*(bar_w+gap)
        bar_h = h*scale
        y = height_px - bar_h
        svg_parts.append(f"<rect x='{x}' y='{y}' width='{bar_w}' height='{bar_h}' fill='black'/>")
    svg_parts.append("</svg>")
    return "\n".join(svg_parts)

D. JS — decode 23-bar from a captured image (high level)

Capture bounding box of barcode

Divide width into 23 equal columns

For each column, compute fraction of black pixels from bottom up → map to height level 1..8.

Verify fixed bars at 1,12,23; recompute UID by reversing base8 → reconstruct hash mapping or lookup.

Pseudocode:

1. Preprocess frame: grayscale -> gaussian blur -> adaptive threshold
2. Find largest rectangular contour -> crop ROI
3. For i in 0..22:
   x0 = i * col_w
   col = ROI[:, x0:x0+col_w]
   # compute topmost black pixel (assuming bars start from bottom)
   black_frac = sum(black_pixels_in_col)/col_area
   height_level = quantize(black_frac * 8) -> 1..8
4. Verify fixed positions
5. Reconstruct base8 digits from heights-1 -> integer -> try reverse hash lookup? (better: encode direct mapping instead of hash)


Note: If you encode UID deterministically via digest → you cannot invert hash to get original UID. So we must store a mapping encoded_integer -> uid in DB. Use deterministic mapping: instead of SHA digest, compute h = int.from_bytes(sha256(uid), 'big') % (8**20) and store this integer as encoded_value in DB keyed to UID. Decoding yields encoded_value → DB lookup → UID. That's the recommended approach.
