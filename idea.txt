Project Name: "QR on Track: AI-Enabled TrackFit Scanner"
(Hinglish: "TrackFit QR Scanner" - combines "track fittings" with a modern, catchy vibe for Indian Railways.)
This project builds on your updated hardware choice of an ESP32 (Arduino + Wi-Fi combo) for a 2D laser marking system using the Engraver-2 laser module, integrated with the advanced software solution (AI-powered predictive quality, AR-enhanced field interface, and UDM/TMS integration). Below is a detailed breakdown of what needs to be made, how to start, phased development, and role assignments for your team of six (2 ML engineers, 2 full-stack developers, 2 hardware engineers), ensuring feasibility for the Smart India Hackathon 2025.

What Needs to Be Made
Hardware
	• 2D Laser Marking System: 
		○ Components: ESP32 microcontroller (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32, ~$5–10, ₹400–800) for control and Wi-Fi, two Nema-17 stepper motors for X-Y movement, Engraver-2 laser module (10W blue diode, ~$100–200, ₹8,000–16,000), lightweight aluminum frame (20x20cm for prototype), and a basic conveyor or manual feeder for fittings.
		○ Function: Marks 5–10mm Data Matrix QR codes on metal (elastic rail clips, liners), rubber (rail pads), and concrete (sleepers). QR codes encode unique IDs linking to UDM/TMS data (vendor, lot number, supply date, warranty, inspections).
		○ Features: 
			§ Material-adaptive marking: Camera (e.g., OV2640, ~$5, ₹400) with ML model adjusts laser power for metal/rubber/concrete.
			§ Wi-Fi control via ESP32 for remote operation and data sync.
			§ Portable, battery-powered (12V LiPo) for field testing.
		○ Safety: Acrylic enclosure for laser safety (CDRH Class I), ventilation for fumes.
Software
	• QR Scanning Website: 
		○ Scans QR codes on fittings using phone cameras, works offline, and syncs with UDM (www.ireps.gov.in) and TMS (www.irecept.gov.in) via APIs.
		○ Displays vendor details, supply date, warranty, and inspection history.
	• AI Analytics Engine (Python-based): 
		○ Predicts quality issues (e.g., defective batches) using ML (XGBoost/TensorFlow).
		○ Detects anomalies (e.g., early failures) with clustering (DBSCAN).
		○ Forecasts inventory shortages with time-series models (ARIMA/LSTM).
	• AR-Enhanced Field Interface (ARCore/ARKit): 
		○ Overlays data on scanned fittings (e.g., quality status, inspection history) via phone or AR glasses.
		○ Guides workers with AR arrows for maintenance tasks.
		○ Voice-based queries (NLP with BERT) for hands-free use (e.g., “Show defective clips from 2024”).
	• Web Dashboard (Django/React): 
		○ Visualizes AI insights (e.g., failure heatmaps, vendor performance).
		○ Sends alerts (email/SMS) for issues like low stock or warranty expirations.
	• Feedback Loop: AI refines predictions based on field inputs (e.g., “rusted clip”), using reinforcement learning.
Deliverables
	• A working prototype marking QR codes on sample fittings (metal, rubber, concrete).
	• A mobile app with AR, AI analytics, and UDM/TMS integration.
	• A dashboard for managers to monitor quality and inventory.
